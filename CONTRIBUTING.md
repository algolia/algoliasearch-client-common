## Before you start coding

### Editing `README.md` and similar files

Note that some files are managed outside this repository and are committed automatically.

`README.md` are is generated automatically from our doc. If you'd like to see more details about something, feel free to open an issue.

`.github` directory is manage in [this repository](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-common), any Pull Request there are welcome.

## Opening an issue

Each repository provide a template for issues. Please fill the client and language version and provide a clear description of the problem you're facing. Steps to reproduce or example code (repository, jsfiddle and such) are a big help.

## Submitting a pull request

Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.

Here are a few tips to increase the likelihood of being merged:

- [ ] Write tests.
- [ ] Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
- [ ] Allow [edits from maintainers](https://blog.github.com/2016-09-07-improving-collaboration-with-forks/).

### API Breaking changes

We care deeply about backward compatibility for our API clients libraries. If it's necessary, we're ready to break backward compatibility but this is should be pretty rare.

If you want to make breaking changes, open an issue first to discuss it with maintainers.
